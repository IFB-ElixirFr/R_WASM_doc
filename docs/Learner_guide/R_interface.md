# Learn R

## Introduction to the R Interface

On the left, you will find the panel for educational scenarios (information, lessons, and instructions).  
There are two panels on the right side of the interface. The top panel (blue rectangle in the image) is the R console, while the bottom panel (in orange) serves as a visualization panel when on the "PLOT" tab and as a code editor when on the "EDITOR" tab.
